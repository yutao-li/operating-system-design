# operating-system-design
<pre>
    • use x86 instruction set and C language to implement an elementary operating system from the sratch (a FAT12 file system with a main interface, storing one kernel apart from several small programs)
    • Used WinImage to compress and create img file, Winhex to view the binary data of the img file to check whether the sector numbers and the header cluster numbers are correct, DOSBox to test com programs, Bochs to test and debug the operating system
    • Implemented a batch processing system and an interrupt control system, including keyboard interrupt and clock interrupt. Implemented the five-state process model and relevant progress control primitives, and the semaphore mechanism to accomplish complicated process synchronization
    • Defined a process table to achieve multi-processing based on round robin strategy
    • Functions of programs include: display 4 types of character animation on one screen; display information of each process; Greedy Snake game
